Twistr, a Tumblr client.

Description
============

Twistr is a very simple Tumblr client. In this version, it allows you to create posts of these types:

* Video posts, with a maximum upload size of 50MB per video.
* Photo posts, with a maximum upload size of 10MB per photo.
* Audio posts, of MP3 and AIFF files up to 10MB.
* Text posts, in UTF-8 (multilingual).
* Link posts, to share links with friends and family.
* Conversation transcripts, which are read from a plain text file..
* Quote posts.

Installation
============

The install process is very simple. You can either go to github.com/kiike/twistr and choose any download method or
download directly via https://github.com/kiike/twistr/zipball/master. You can also contribute to the code by
forking the git repository and then sending pull requests.


Usage
=====

Run the script after giving it run permissions without any arguments and it will give you brief instructions on its usage.
Tipically you will have to create a file with your login data, chmod it 600 to protect it from curious eyes, and then run
Twistr with the data as the first argument, and then two optional fields that will describe and complement your data.


License
=======

This script is in the public domain. I am not concerned about what you do with it. It may work for you, or not. I will be happy
to help you using it, but being so simple and tested after each release, it won't be needed.
